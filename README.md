Java Spring MVC Example
=======================

This is a small example Java Spring MVC application, which is primarily used
to teach (and learn) more about the spring framework.

You can easily run the project by invoking Maven with the goal "tomcat:run".

The application is fairly simple and is not using many Spring features for the
sake of simplicity. The idea was rather to show how the controllers can be set
up to serve views for different requests and how to unit tests the controllers.
