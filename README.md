Java Spring MVC Example
=======================

This is a small example Java Spring MVC application, which is primarily used
to teach (and learn more) about the Spring framework.

You can easily run the project by invoking Maven with the goal "tomcat:run".

The application is fairly simple and provides basic example implementations for
typical features of a Spring application.

Overview

Currently the following features are implemented:
 * user registration and login via Spring Security
 * test cases for controllers, models and integration tests
 * simple CRUD operations in form of a micro-blogging service
 * usage of MongoDB
 
Future

 * Spring Web Flow example
 * Hibernate and transaction management
 * REST with Spring and Jersey
